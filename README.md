## Description

Note taker is an application meant to help the user save information such as notes in one place. These notes will be saved to a db.json document so it will persist. The user will be able to make new notes, view old notes, and delete them. The main goal of this project is to help the user stay organized and keep important information or reminders in one place. This project was done using Node.js and Express.js for the backend (front-end was already provided). Using express.js I was able to practice and understand this library better, I was able to serve static files such as the index.html and the notes.html when different routes were requested, and I was able to use CRUD operations to GET, POST, and DELETE notes from the db.json file.

## Installation

This application will require node.js. With node.js installed the user must clone the repo and open up the terminal. The user will then have to install all dependencies by running the commant:

```
npm install

```

then the user will have to run the server by running the command:

```
 node ./server.js

```

and follow the link that pops up in the terminal

## Usage

This project can be used to store information such as notes, reminders, passwords, etc. The information will be stored when the save button on the top right is clicked, once done the note will appear on the left side where it can be viewed or deleted.
The deployed version of this project can be found in the following link:
